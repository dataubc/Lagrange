# Salama

 I blog about data science, study design, predictive modeling, and issues related to data privacy and security in [my personal blog](https://dataubc.github.io/Salama/)


> Theme is adopted from Lagrange, a minimalist Jekyll theme for running a personal blog or sit [the demosite](https://lenpaul.github.io/Lagrange/).
