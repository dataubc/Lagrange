How drug overdose is stealing lives from us!

According to recent article published by the journal of Drug and Alcohol Dependence, Connecticut, U.S has suffered from a sever escalation in overdose deaths in the period between 2012 and 2018. This has prompted the attention of health professionals and public policy makers and research institutions to understand the roots of this issue.

To contribute to the effort towards the prevention of accidental death overdose in Connecticut, I was in invloved in two projects that will assist the health professionals, public policy makers and research institutions to identify the people who are most vulnerable to die from accidental overdose. Two visualization apps in Python and R were created including user-interactive plots and graphs linking to different attributes of the people who lost their lives to the accidental overdose including their age, gender, and ethnicity and the number of drugs contributed to the death.

Here, I am sharing a new visualization for the same data using Power BI. The user can select to filter the data using the race of the victim and the location of death.
