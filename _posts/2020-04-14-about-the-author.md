Combining the rigorousness of engineering and the deep insights of data science, the love of philosophy and the passion for story telling, I am a multipotentialite with eagerness for knowledge who is looking for the next opportunity to harvest his rich experience and skills to create, design, analyze , initiate, play, share and change the world into a better place for all.

I am currently pursuing a master of data science at The University of British Columbia.
