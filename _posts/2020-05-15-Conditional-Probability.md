To take any decision in life, we need information. Based on the information we have we will choose one alternative over the others. However, often when we get a new information, we go back and choose a different alternative than the one we chose before. The conditional probability is analogous to the process we do when we revise a decision if new information is provided.

Let’s say you won two tickets for the next Oiler game and you are trying to decide who you should invite to attend the game with you. You have six friends and you know that each one has the same probability to attend the game which is, let’s assume, about 50%. It is good to have a free ticket to the Oiler game; but that game in particular is not important since it is just the beginning of the season. Now ,if your friend Sam has just called you and let you know that he will not be working on the day of the game, then you will think that the probability of Sam accepting your invitation is likely higher than 50%. The fact this probability has changed
from its initial value is expressed by what is called conditional probability.

`Conditional probability` is about finding how a new relative information can change the value of initial probability of something happening. In the example above the probability that Sam attends the game has changed after a new information came to light. Let’s try another example , but now we will see how a new information would change the probability that you attend the game. You were trying to find the chance that another one would come with you to the game assuming that the chance that you attend the game is 100%.
The conditional probability is like the chance that you go to the game knowing that the best player in the team had an injury . This new information means that you expect there will be less chance that you go to the game, and hence you don’t really enjoy watching your favorite team losing, there is less chance that you would attend the game. The information that you have got has changed the chance that you attend the game.
