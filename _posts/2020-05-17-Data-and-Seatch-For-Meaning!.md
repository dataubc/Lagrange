The title is borrowed from the great book Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl1. In this post, I will try to shed light on how data could be used to help us find meaning in the world.



It is always been said that data science is about turning data into meaningful knowledge about the world but what we mean by that. We know from my favourite philosopher Kant2 that our knowledge about the world will always be different than reality . Kant differentiates between two concepts: Things in themselves "what they are" and their appearances" what they appear to be". We could only form a representation that as close as possible to the reality, and we keep changing our representation of the world until we are satisfied that it is close enough to the reality.



Data is all about collecting signals from appearances to get as close as possible to know the reality about "things in themselves". It is exactly like the story about the blind men and an elephant. The story goes that a group of blind men, who have never heard about elephants, were asked to touch an elephant and tell what they think by just by touching part of it.  Each one of the blind men assumed that the animal is only represented by that part that he can touch. Since each man was sensing a different part of the elephant, their "knowledge" about the world could only depict an incomplete image about the "reality" of the world. Using the data from as many blind men as possible men could improve this image to make it as close as possible to the true reality. Therefore, getting knowledge from the data is always about how much signals is there in the "data quality", in addition to the volume of data we have "data quantity". One could see that the image we create about reality will be as good as our data. 



Data come in different forms and flavours. But what we want to know is if the data is relevant to the question we ask, in the example above we want to know what is the animal. Sensing the skin of elephant is a reaonable method in this case to answer the question. Other things such as the time of the day or the temperature is of no direct value. So in addition to the data quality and quantity we want to always make sure that we have a relevant data. If the variable we want to know is unobservable we could resort to the proxy data that is not directly relevant to the variables of interest.



But how is using data to answer questions is different from other methods,can't we just observe reality. Some times we are lucky and we could do that. For example, one could roughly calculate the acceleration of gravity by measuring the distances/speed of fall travelled by a falling object. But in many instances,  it could be either impossible or impractical to observe all the variables needed to find the "reality" we seek. Hence, we try to recreate this reality using a mathematical model. The first thing we should know about model that they are all wrongs, but some are useful as well put by statistician George Box. Great deal of data science is about creating and interpreting models. Models are useful not only because they could tell us something about what the "reality" looks like now, but also because it allows to predict what they reality could look like in the future. 



But how do we know that our model is valid. We need an evaluation metric that measure how close our model to the truth, this could done by testing our model performance and compare it with the real results. Often we need to go back and modify our model until we are satisfied with the results. We could modify the model by adjusting its parameters.

In summary, data science could help us turn the data into meaningful knowledge by offering the possibility of building interpretable models that are close to reality as possible. Data scientist save time and cost and even lives by testing different scenarios first on these models and predict their consequences before applying them in real life.
