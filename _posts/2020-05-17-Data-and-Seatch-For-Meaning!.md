The title is borrowed from the great book Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl^[1]. In this post, I am trying to shed light on how data could be used to help us find truth about the world.

It is always been said that data science is about turning data into knowledge about the world but what we mean by that. We know from my favourite philosopher Kant that the world exists in isolation from what we think about it. Kant differentiates between two concepts: Things in themselves "what they are" and their appearances" what they appear to be".  

Data is all about collecting signals from appearances to get as close as possible to know the reality about "things in themselves". It is exactly like the story about the blind men and an elephant. The story goes that a group of blind men, who have never heard about elephants, were asked to touch an elephant and tell what they think by just by touching part of it.  Each one of the blind men assumed that the animal is only represented by that part that he can tocuh. Since each man was sensing a different part of the elephant, their "knowledge" about the world could only depict an incomplete image about the "reality" of the world. Using the data from as many blind men as possible men could improve this image to make it as close as possible to the true reality. Therefore, getting knowledge from the data is always about how much signals is there in the data "data quality", in addition to the volume of data we have "data quantity". 

But why we need the data to get knowledge, can't we just observe reality. Some times we are lucky and we could do that. For example, one could raoughly calculate the accelration of gravity by meauring the distances/speed of fall travelled by a falling object. But in many instances,  it could be either immpossible or impractical to observe all the variables needed to find the "reality" we seek. Hence, we try to recreate this reality using a mahemtical model. The first thing we should know about model that they are all wrongs, but some are usefull as well put by statistician George Box. Great deal of data science is about creating and interpeting models. Models are useful not only becuase they could tell us something about what the "reality" looks like now, but also because it allows to predict what they reality could look like in the future.
