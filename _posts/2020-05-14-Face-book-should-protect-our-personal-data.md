As we are moving into the digital space and virtual worlds, new opportunities are offered in terms of connecting people but new threats also arise due to the exact nature of this connection. In the old days, you could have an intimate chat with a friend, or expressing a political opinion in a coffee-shop resting assured that you have great control over who should know about that chat/belief/opinion. However, in the age of Facebook and Twitter, an increasing amount of this conversations are taking place in mediums that we know how little about how it works about let alone knowing how much of these conversations are revealed to the public or how much of the data is sold to third-parties.  This little pieces of us that are being collected over time including our tweets/likes/shares are eventually sold to parties that would in many-cases use them to manipulate users for their interests. In political event such as elections that means more polarization and division could be fueled as more groups in Facebook is being created by false personalities. In unstable and failed states that means spreading hate speech and racial divisions or even inciting violence. That being said I think  it is clear that this type of platforms , owner should be totally responsible for the contents on their platforms.

 

First, there are mounting evidences that suggest that Facebook, for example, is driving and shaping how people interact with news. This is simply because we know that they have personally tailored news-feed that control what individuals see. Furthermore, we know that they indeed sell personal information such as likes/shares to third parties that often use them for targeted ads. I can see no condition under which we could couple this fact with Facebook claim that is only a technology provider and not a media company as Mark Zuckerberg usually says(1) . The question, in my opinion, is not whether Facebook should be held accountable for the contents in its platform but what public  could do about it. 

 

One thing we could do is to make sure that Facebook is not selling the information of users without their consent. Second, I believe users should be given more control over contents by allowing them to delete posts hat they see as dangerous to the public. For example, a post that has a certain number of dislikes should automatically be deleted. This will give back people some(power) over the contents instead of consolidating it when only Facebook could do that. In summary, I think there is strong evidence that suggests that Facebook completely should responsible for media content on its platform since it is involved in many ways on the quality/quantity of this content and how is served/distributed to the users beside the facts that users has little control over contents.
