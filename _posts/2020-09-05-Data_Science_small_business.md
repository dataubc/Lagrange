It has long been appreciated the critical role of data science in the success of big corporations, banks, technology companies, government agencies, and International Organizations, but I believe that small business owners, equally in developed and developing countries, are in much dire need of insights that could be gained from it. There are many examples of how data science tools could improve the way small business is conducted through analyzing data produced by the business itself to maximize productivity, reduce cost, understand opportunities and risks, etc but here I am going to give one example of the how data science could be used to reduce risks and exposure through analyzing external data sources and news trend.

Let's take as an example of Adam, who is a farmer who owns a small farm in Africa. He is producing crop X this season. He has worked very hard, and as a result achieved high production, good for him. Unfortunately, though the demand for his crop is weak and the price is very low and he is almost driven to bankruptcy, why? Not because of the lack of skills or productivity, but rather due to lack of information!

What information? The information that the government in Country Y has provided lucrative incentives to its farmers to produce the same crop, which has led to a massive amount of crop X supplied to the market at much cheaper prices than the break-even price for Adam's crop. Was this information readily available to Adam while he was planning to grow crops perhaps in the news? maybe, but we don't expect a small business owner in Africa to follow, analyze, and get insights from the news that is flooding everywhere theses days. It's more likely that a careful data science analysis through the modeling structured data such as data from the harvest of previous years, prices, etc published in government's websites and international organizations such as FAO. In addition, unstructured data such as news from Twitter feed and other sources could be analyzed using Natural Language Processing NLP tools for information extraction to draw a clear idea about the prediction of crop X supply and expected prices. Such information is pivotal to decision making and could have potentially saved the livelihood of Adam!

In short, small business owners should incorporate data science tools sooner rather than later in order to thrive in a global and interconnected market where information is the most critical key to success.
